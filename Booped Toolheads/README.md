# MiniSB: Hackyboi
It's a combination of [MiniSB-Sharkfin and MiniSB-LGX Lite by Maverick](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Maverick) with modifications to fit the Boop Beta 4 carriage.

Are you tired of reprinting your cowling every time you change your configuration? I was. 
HackyBoi fits just about every combination of hotend and extruder you can come up with.

Changes from Beta 3 version: 
- Adjusted the shelf to fit the Beta4's upper
- Discontinued the Rapido version - use my new [Rapido mount](https://github.com/cosmonate/VoronStuff/Rapido_HF_Mount) instead. 

Also in this folder: 
A CAD for MiniSB-LGX Lite modified for Boop Beta 3. It's just extra weight with no benefit over HackyBoi. 
Archived version for Boop Beta 3, including the old Rapido version.
