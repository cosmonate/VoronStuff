# MiniSB: Hackyboi
It's a combination of [MiniSB-Sharkfin and MiniSB-LGX Lite by Maverick](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Maverick) with modifications to fit the Boop Beta 3 carriage.

Are you tired of reprinting your cowling every time you change your configuration? I was. 
HackyBoi fits just about every combination of hotend and extruder you can come up with.
Comes in both regular and Rapido versions.

Also in this folder: 
A mod of the Rapido hotend mount with a tigher fit for the mounting screws.
A CAD for MiniSB-LGX Lite modified for Boop Beta 3. It's just extra weight with no benefit over HackyBoi.
