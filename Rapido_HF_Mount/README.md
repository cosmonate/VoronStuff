# Rapido HF Mount BETA 
![CAD](Images/CAD.jpg?raw=true "Rapido HF Mount CAD")
What is it? It's a Rapido Highflow mount for normal length MiniSB and related toolheads. Yeah, it fits. 

WARNING: This thing is a beta. I've been running it 40+ hours with no heatcreep issues (~1.5c above chamber temp on average), but your mileage my vary. 

BOM:
- Rapido HF
- 4x M2.5x8 Flat Head Cap Screws
- 1x 3010 Axial Fan with high static pressure - I used Honeybadger P-Series 24V, Delta might also work (untested)

How to install:
1. Reconfigure your Rapido so that the wires will face the way mine do (see images). You can do this by removing the heatbreak and rotating it. 
2. If using Boop, you will need to remove some of the wire protector to allow airflow.
3. (optional) If you are using a PT1000 version, you can install an additional heatsink monitoring thermistor in the channel. Just press it in with some boron nitride paste. 
4. Snap the Rapido into the mount by first shoving in the top, then rotating the nozzle end down toward the front.
